Ultimate AI Image to Text Prompt Knowledge Base
POCKET CINEMA x NATHAN HISTED
Version 7.0: The Architect Edition
OVERVIEW
Pocket Cinema is not just a prompt generator; it is a Visual Director.
Designed for filmmakers, photographers, and creative directors, this application bridges the gap between technical AI parameters and cinematic language. It translates your creative intent (Lighting, Camera, Mood) into the precise mathematical language required by advanced AI models like Midjourney, Flux, and Stable Diffusion.
CORE FEATURES (v7.0)
1. The Generator (Visual Director)
Multi-Reel Logic: Upload up to 10 reference images.
Drag-and-Drop Sequencing: Drag images to reorder priority—the AI reads the sequence from left to right.
Troubleshooting Engine: If a prompt fails, tell the "Fix It" engine what went wrong, and it will rewrite the script automatically.
2. Get The Look (Reverse Engineering)
Upload any image to extract its "Digital DNA."
The system analyzes the lighting ratios, estimated focal length, and color grade to provide a "Master Prompt" you can use to recreate that exact aesthetic.
3. The Vault (Educational Library)
The Rosetta Stone: A complete translation guide for parameters across the Top 10 models.
Lens Theory: Detailed breakdowns of how focal lengths (16mm vs 85mm) affect subject emotion.
Hierarchy of Realism: Definitions of "Photorealistic" vs. "Hyperrealistic" vs. "8K RAW."
4. AI Glossary
A comprehensive, A-Z dictionary of every technical AI term (Latent Space, Diffusion, CFG, LoRA) explained in "Explain Like I'm Five" plain English.
5. How It Works
A deep-dive masterclass into the mechanics of Diffusion and Latent Space, demystifying the "ghost in the machine."
USAGE
API Key: This application requires a Google Gemini API Key to function. It runs locally in your browser; your key is never sent to a third-party server.
Input: Upload your references, select your target platform (e.g., Midjourney), and input your Director's Notes.
Output: Copy the generated "Script" (Prompt) and paste it into your AI generation tool of choice.
